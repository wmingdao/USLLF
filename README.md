# The Text Dataset for USLLF
This repo is a text dataset for Modeling the Skeleton-Language Uncertainty for 3D Action Recognition (USLLF). The paper has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia.

This dataset is designed to describe the execution process of human actions including 1200 samples, which is divided into two types: (1) global description (600 samples) and (2) part description (600 samples). The length of each sample does not exceed 90 words. Note that the action categories described in this dataset match those of **[NTU 60](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Shahroudy_NTU_RGBD_A_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)**.
